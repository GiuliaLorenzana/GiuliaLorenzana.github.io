I am a postdoctoral fellow at [NITMB](https://www.nitmb.org/) in Chicago. I am part of the [Vitelli Group](https://home.uchicago.edu/~vitelli/index.html) and [Doiron Lab](https://brainmath.bsd.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. 

I work at the interface between the **Statistical Physics** of **Disordered Systems** and complex biological systems, ranging from **Theoretical Community Ecology** to **Neuroscience**. On the one hand, systems of interacting species or neurons can be studied using the tools developed for randomly interacting spins. On the other hand, biological dynamics are characterised by non-equilibrium features that are not found in classical models of disordered systems, such as non-reciprocal interactions and migration. This makes their study intriguing also from the point of view of Theoretical Physics.

I obtained my PhD thesis in **Theoretical Physics** at [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/) and [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/en/), under the supervision of [Giulio Biroli](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/giulio-biroli/) and [Ada Altieri](https://www.adaaltieri.com/).
