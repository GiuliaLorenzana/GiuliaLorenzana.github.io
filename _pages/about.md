I recently defended my PhD thesis in Theoretical Physics between [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/) and [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/en/), under the supervision of [Giulio Biroli](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/giulio-biroli/) and [Ada Altieri](https://www.adaaltieri.com/). I will soon be starting a postdoctoral fellowship at [NITMB](https://www.nitmb.org/) in Chicago.

I work at the interface between the Statistical Physics of Disordered Systems and Theoretical Community Ecology. On the one hand, systems of interacting species can be studied using the tools developed for randomly interacting spins. On the other hand, the dynamics of ecosystems are characterised by non-equilibrium features that are not found in classical models of disordered systems, such as non-reciprocal interactions and migration. This makes their study interesting also from a theoretical physics point of view.
