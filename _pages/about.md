I am a PhD student in Theoretical Physics between [Laboratoire de Physique de l'École Normale Supérieure](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/) and [Matière et Systèmes Complexes lab](https://fr.u-paris.fr/laboratoires/matiere-et-systemes-complexes), under the supervision of Giulio Biroli and Ada Altieri. My main interest is the Statistical Physics of Disordered Systems and its applications to Theoretical Ecology, with a focus on out-of-equilibrium dynamics.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
