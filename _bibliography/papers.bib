  abstract = {The random Lotka-Volterra model is widely used to describe the dynamical and thermodynamic features of ecological communities. In this work, we consider random symmetric interactions between species and analyze the strongly competitive interaction case. We investigate different scalings for the distribution of the interactions with the number of species and try to bridge the gap with previous works. Our results show two different behaviors for the mean abundance at zero and finite temperature, respectively, with a continuous crossover between the two. We confirm and extend previous results obtained for weak interactions: at zero temperature, even in the strong competitive interaction limit, the system is in a multiple-equilibria phase, whereas at finite temperature only a unique stable equilibrium can exist. Finally, we establish the qualitative phase diagrams and compare the species abundance distributions in the two cases.},

  abstract = {We study numerically Anderson localization on lattices that are tree-like except for the presence of one loop of varying length \$L\$. The resulting expressions allow us to compute corrections to the Bethe lattice solution on i) Random-Regular-Graph (RRG) of finite size \$N\$ and ii) euclidean lattices in finite dimension. In the first case we show that the \$1/N\$ corrections to to the average values of observables such as the typical density of states and the inverse participation ratio have prefactors that diverge exponentially approaching the critical point, which explains the puzzling observation that the numerical simulations on finite RRGs deviate spectacularly from the expected asymptotic behavior. In the second case our results, combined with the \$M\$-layer expansion, predict that corrections destroy the exotic critical behavior of the Bethe lattice solution in any finite dimension, strengthening the suggestion that the upper critical dimension of Anderson localization is infinity. This approach opens the way to the computation of non-mean-field critical exponents by resumming the series of diverging diagrams through the same recipes of the field-theoretical perturbative expansion.},

	abstract = {We study how migration and interactions can rescue species-rich, spatially structured ecosystems from extinction due to demographic noise. For a single species, one finds an extinction and a survival state depending on the strength of the demographic noise with respect to migration. The transition between these two regimes is a second-order out-of-equilibrium phase transition, which falls into the universality class of Directed Percolation. Here we show that the case of many species with heterogeneous interactions is different and richer. When the demographic fluctuations are strong enough, the transition is continuous and analogous to the single-species case. Ecological interactions play a secondary role in it. At small demographic noise, instead, we find novel features that are a signature of the complexity of the ecosystem. Thanks to interactions and migration, the metacommunity is able to thrive even when demographic noise would drive single species to extinction. This is accompanied by the development of mutualism between non-extinct species. The transition becomes discontinuous and a global bistability emerges. We present a way to predict the catastrophic shift from high diversity to extinction by probing responses to perturbations as early warning signal. Our analytical framework is grounded in statistical physics and focuses on a model of metacommunities based on Lotka-Volterra equations with random interactions.},
